Project Synesthesia lets you experience the unspoken relationship between color
and sound.  Send your audio into the fixture and watch what you’re hearing
light the room. Project Synesthesia is a visualizer for your space, not your
screen, and its programmed by anything it hears.

Project Synesthesia has two parts, the LED Array and the Controller. 

The LED Array
The LED Array is comprised of strips of individually addressable RGB LEDs.
The LED Array can display any combination of colors in its light.  The LEDs in
the LED Array will be the brightest possible LEDs so as to adequately light a
room.  The LEDs will be networked in serial in a way that the color pattern of
the LED Array in whole will refresh at greater than 30 Hz.

The Controller
The LED Array will be controlled by a controlling embedded system.  The
Controller will receive an analog stereo audio stream and perform analog to
digital conversion.  Software in the embedded system will direct the LED
Array’s light display by mapping intensity and color to qualities of the audio
stream such as its short term trends in intensity and its frequency spectrum.
The Controller will run on a small Linux environment on a small ARM board that
must be fast enough for digital signal processing and also have an analog
stereo audio input and a tolerable analog to digital converter.
